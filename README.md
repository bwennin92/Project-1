# Project-1

For this project I was using technologies such as Youtube as reference to building my project.
I designed a wire frame to organize what approach to take first. My first approach was to get my HTML set up, CSS set up to present the colored sections on the webpage and then start making the functions on my Javascript.

For the instructions hit the box next to power to start the game! Once you do that hit the play button to begin playing! You have to match the highlighted colors that pop up in sequence after the computer highlights it.

I was not able to wrap my head around setting up the player input to show that the player got the sequence correct. I got help from Kagan,Andrew, Kareem, and Justin but I just couldnt put my thoughts together to make it work. I need help and 15 minutes isnt enough for me to fully wrap my head around it.
